<h2>Experience</h2>
<p><strong>Senior Software Engineer</strong> <em>Giesecke+Devrient, Munich, Germany; 2023-present</em></p>
<p>I work on one of the most promising <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_bank_digital_currency">Central Bank Digital Currency (CBDC)</a> already used by several countries with real users and banks, with <em>Rust</em>, <em>C++</em>, <em>Go</em>, <em>Docker</em> and <em>Kubernetes</em>, with the highest levels of availability, correctness, security, and regulatory constraints.</p>
<p>There, I initiated and led the effort to rewrite an insecure and crucial C++ codebase in Rust running on 10+ platforms as well as mentoring teammates to learn Rust &amp; C++.</p>
<p><strong>Back-end Software Engineer &amp; DevOps</strong> <em>PPRO, Munich, Germany; 2017-2023</em></p>
<p>I wrote and deployed end-to-end Fintech web services that serve millions of customers worldwide with billions of euros in transaction volume, in a variety of tech stacks (<em>Go</em>, <em>C++</em>, <em>Kotlin</em>, <em>Docker</em>, <em>Kubernetes</em>, <em>Terraform</em>), with high availability and regulatory constraints.
I also helped moving multiple services from the data center to the cloud without disruption or customers even noticing.
I also have taken on DevOps &amp; SRE responsabilities such as adding logging, metrics, alerting, distributed tracing and performance monitoring to existing software in order to increase their reliability, as well as guaranteeing SLAs crucial to the business. I did on-call for business critical services, and I conducted numerous technical interviews.</p>
<p><strong>Full-stack Software Engineer</strong> <em>EdgeLab, Lausanne, Switzerland; 2015-2017</em></p>
<p>I joined a Fintech startup and helped the product (risk analytics &amp; investment decision making application) go to the next level by introducing internationalization, OAuth, Continuous Integration, and upgrading to the latest language standards (<em>ECMAScript 6</em>, <em>C++14</em>), and worked among other things on the quantitative prediction algorithms in <em>C++</em>.
The startup was later acquired by a major Swiss bank for a 8 digit number.</p>
<p><strong>CNRS Intern Software Engineer experimenting with the Oculus Rift (VR)</strong> <em>CNRS, Strasbourg, France; 2014</em></p>
<p>3D Oculus Rift (virtual reality) visualization software of astronomical data for pedagogical and research purposes in <em>C</em>, <em>C++</em> and <em>OpenGL 3.3</em>.</p>
<p><strong>Intern Software Engineer</strong> <em>Crédit Mutuel (Bank), Strasbourg, France; 2013</em></p>
<p>I migrated a <em>COBOL</em> mainframe accounting application to a <em>C#</em> web application with some new parts in <em>COBOL</em> for one of the biggest banks in the country.</p>
