Experience
----------

**Back-end Software Engineer and DevOps** *PPRO, Munich, Germany; 2017-present*

I write and deploy end-to-end Fintech web services that serve millions of customers worldwide with billions of euros in transaction volume, in a variety of tech stacks (*Go*, *C++*, *Kotlin*, *Docker*, *Kubernetes*, *Terraform*), with high availability and regulatory constraints.
I also help moving multiple services from the data center to the cloud without disruption or customers even noticing.
Lately, I have been moving more and more to DevOps & SRE responsabilities such as adding logging, metrics, alerting, distributed tracing and performance monitoring to existing software in order to increase their reliability, as well as guaranteeing SLAs crucial to the business. I do on-call and technical interviews.

**Full-stack Software Engineer** *EdgeLab, Lausanne, Switzerland; 2015-2017*

I joined a Fintech startup and helped the product (risk analytics & investment decision making application) go to the next level by introducing internationalization, OAuth, Continuous Integration, and upgrading to the latest language standards (*ECMAScript 6*, *C++14*). 
The startup was later acquired by a major Swiss bank for a 8 digit number.

**CRNS Intern Software Engineer experimenting with Oculus Rift (VR)** *CNRS, Strasbourg, France; 2014*

3D Oculus Rift (virtual reality) visualization software of astronomical data for pedagogical and research purposes in *C*, *C++* and *OpenGL 3.3*.

**Intern Software Engineer** *Crédit Mutuel (Bank), Strasbourg, France; 2013*

I migrated a *COBOL* mainframe accounting application to a *C#* web application with some new parts in *COBOL* for one of the biggest banks in the country (please don't hire me for a COBOL job).
